User's Guide
============

This section will eventually contain a user's guide for ``stdexec`` that describes what the library
is, the high-level concepts on which it is based, and how to use it.

.. _CoreConceptsForUsers:

ðŸ§± Core Concepts for Users
--------------------------

From the perspective of the user, the core concepts of the Sender model are the
**sender** abstraction, the **scheduler** abstraction, and **sender algorithms**.

1. Scheduler
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **scheduler** is an object that provides a way to schedule work. They are lightweight
handles to what is often a heavy-weight and immovable **execution context**. Execution
contexts are where work actually happens, and they can be anything that can execute code.
Examples of execution contexts:

- Thread pools.
- Event loops.
- GPUs.
- An I/O subsystem.
- Any other execution model.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sched = exec::get_parallel_scheduler();   // Obtain the default system scheduler
    auto sndr  = stdexec::schedule(sched);         // Create a sender from the scheduler

The sender you get back from ``stdexec::schedule`` is a factory for operations that,
when started, will immediately call ``set_value()`` on the receiver the operation was
constructed with. And crucially, it does so from the context of the scheduler. Work
is executed on a context by chaining continuations to one of these senders, and passing
it to one of the algorithms that starts work, like ``stdexec::sync_wait``.

2. Sender
^^^^^^^^^

A **sender** is an object that describes an asynchronous computation that may happen
later. It can do nothing on its own, but when connected to a receiver, it returns an
**operation state** that can start the work described by the sender.

``stdexec`` provides a set of generic **sender algorithms** that can be used to chain
operations together. There are also algorithms, like ``stdexec::sync_wait``, that can
be used to launch the sender. The sender algorithms take care of connecting the sender
to a receiver and managing the lifetime the operation state.

- Produces values (or errors) asynchronously.

- Can be requested to stop early.

- Supports composition.

- Is lazy (does nothing until connected and started).

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto sndr = stdexec::just(42);                    // Sender that yields 42 immediately
    auto [result] = stdexec::sync_wait(sndr).value(); // Start the work & wait for the result
    assert(result.value() == 42);

ðŸ§® Composition via Algorithms
-----------------------------

One benefit of the lazy evaluation of senders is that it makes it possible to create
reusable algorithms that can be composed together. ``stdexec`` provides a rich set of
algorithms that can be used to build complex asynchronous workflows.

A **sender factory algorithm** creates a sender that can be used to start an operation.
Below are some of the key sender factory algorithms provided by ``stdexec``:

.. list-table:: Sender Factory Algorithms

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::schedule`
    - Obtains a sender from a scheduler.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::just`
    - Creates a sender that will immediately complete with a set of values.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::read_env`
    - Reads a value from the receiver's environment and completes with it.

A **sender adaptor algorithm** takes an existing sender (or several senders) and
transforms it into a new sender with additional behavior. Below are some key sender
adaptor algorithms. Check the :ref:`Reference` section for additional algorithms.

.. list-table:: Sender Adaptor Algorithms
  :class: tight-table

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::then`
    - Applies a function to the value from a sender.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::starts_on`
    - Executes an async operation on the specified scheduler.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::continues_on`
    - Executes an async operation on the current scheduler and then transfers
      execution to the specified scheduler.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::on`
    - Executes an async operation on a different scheduler and then transitions
      back to the original scheduler.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::when_all`
    - Combines multiple senders, making it possible to execute them in parallel.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::let_value`
    - Executes an async operation dynamically based on the results of a specified
      sender.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::write_env`
    - Writes a value to the receiver's environment, allowing it to be used by
      child operations.

A **sender consumer algorithm** takes a sender connects it to a receiver and starts the
resulting operation. Here are some key sender consumer algorithms:

.. list-table:: Sender Consumer Algorithms

  * - **CPO**
    - **Description**
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::sync_wait`
    - Blocks the calling thread until the sender completes and returns the result.
  * - :cpp:member:`stdexec::start_detached`
    - Starts the operation without waiting for it to complete.

Here is an example of using sender algorithms to create a simple async pipeline:

.. code-block:: cpp

                    // Create a sender that produces a value:
    auto pipeline = stdexec::just(42)
                    // Transform the value using `then` on the specified scheduler:
                  | stdexec::on(some_scheduler, stdexec::then([](int i) { return i * 2; }))
                    // Further transform the value using `then` on the starting scheduler:
                  | stdexec::then([](int i) { return i + 1; });
                    // Finally, wait for the result:
    auto [result] = stdexec::sync_wait(std::move(pipeline)).value();


ðŸ”„ Coroutine Integration
------------------------

Senders can be ``co_await``-ed in coroutines if they model ``awaitable_sender``. Any sender
that can complete successfully in exactly one way is an awaitable sender.

.. code-block:: cpp

    auto my_task() -> exec::task<int> {
      int x = co_await some_sender();
      co_return x + 1;
    }

If a sender that is being ``co_await``-ed completes with an error, the coroutine will
throw an exception. If it completes with a stop, the coroutine will be canceled. That is,
the coroutine will never be resumed; rather, it and its calling coroutines will be
destroyed.

In addition, all awaitable types can be used as senders, allowing them to be composed with
sender algorithms.

This allows ergonomic, coroutine-based async programming with sender semantics under the
hood.
