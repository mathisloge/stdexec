Welcome to ``stdexec``
======================

``stdexec`` is the reference implementation for `C++26's asynchronous execution framework
<https://eel.is/c++draft/exec>`_,  ``std::execution``. It provides a modern,
composable, and efficient abstraction for asynchronous programming in C++.

The Sender Abstraction in C++26
===============================

The **Sender abstraction** is a foundational model for asynchronous programming in modern
C++, proposed for standardization in **C++26**. It aims to unify and modernize
asynchronous workflows across the C++ ecosystem.

ðŸ”§ Motivation
--------------

C++'s legacy async mechanisms â€” ``std::async``, futures, coroutines, callbacks, threads,
mutexes, etc. â€” have several limitations:

- Inflexible and hard to compose safely.

- No way to specify *where* work should execute.

- Runtime overhead, dynamic allocations, and shared ownership.

- Difficult to customize or extend.

- Incompatible across ecosystems (e.g., Boost, Folly, Abseil, etc.).


The Sender abstraction introduces a compositional model of async computations that
separates concerns cleanly, enabling:

- A unified async model: Works for compute, I/O, networking, UI, etc.

- Generic algorithms that capture common async patterns.

- Combinators for building async workflows.

- Structured cancellation and error handling.

- Coroutine integration: ``co_await`` senders directly within coroutines and pass
  awaitables to sender algorithms.

- Zero-overhead composition (compile-time plumbing with no runtime allocations or
  reference counting).

- Full support for customization: Plug in your own schedulers, senders, adaptors,
  allocators, stop tokens, etc.

ðŸš¦ Standardization Status (as of 2025)
--------------------------------------

- The core Sender model has been accepted into the C++ standard for C++26.

- Additional facilities have also been accepted such as

  * a system scheduler,

  * a sender-aware coroutine task type,

  * an async scope for spawning tasks dynamically.

- Interop with networking is being explored for C++29.

- Widely prototyped and tested in libraries and production settings.

ðŸ”š Summary
-----------

The Sender abstraction:

- Brings modern, composable async programming to C++.

- Serves as a foundation for future concurrency features.

- Enables high-performance, coroutine-friendly workflows.

- Is set to become the standard async model in C++26.
